Introduction
Each group have to submit an Information System project proposal that describes the organization they have selected. Conduct a systems analysis of the proposed project by performing 3 phases of SDLC (planning, analysis, and design) for a small (real or imaginary) organization. The actual project implementation is not required (i.e., No coding required.) You need to apply what you have learned in the class and to participate in the team project work.
Deliverables
This project should follow the main steps of the first three phases of the SDLC (phase 1, 2 and 3). Details description and diagrams should be included in each phase.

 

Part 1: Planning Phase
Under this section, include the following
•	Give the problem description and project scope statement of your selected project topic. (1 mark) 
•	Adopt an SDLC development methodology (1 mark)  
•	Develop a work plan (Gantt chart) (1 mark)  
Answer:  



Part 2: Analysis phase
In this section, you are required to determine the main business requirements; consequently, the following must be included:
•	 Model Processes (Data Flow Diagramming) (2 mark)  
•	Draw the usecase diagram and the give the written usecase description for any two activities. (2 mark) 
•	Model data (ER modeling) (2 mark)  

Answer: 
 
Part 3: Design phase
Under this section, include the following:
•	Transform the ER diagram from the previous phase: Develop the logical and physical database design. (2 marks)  
•	Screens Design (create the User Interface Structure Design), and sample system screens, forms, and reports design. No need to be in HTML, they can be just drawing of how the screen will appear. (2 marks)  
•	Design and appropriate Architecture for your proposed system (1 mark)
